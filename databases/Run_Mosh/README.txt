🔍 Title: Creating, Populating, and Manipulating a Database – Run Monash (RM)

📝 Overview
This assignment involves creating and interacting with a relational database for a fictional event system, Run Monash (RM). It focuses on SQL schema creation, data manipulation, complex queries, and NoSQL operations using MongoDB.

The tasks require translating a logical schema into working SQL code, populating and updating the database, writing advanced SQL queries, modifying the schema, and performing equivalent operations using JSON and MongoDB.

🧾 Scenario Summary: Run Monash Carnival

RM events are hosted across Monash campuses during different seasons and years
Each carnival includes various event types (e.g., Marathon, 10K Run, 3K Walk)
Competitors register once and may enter one event per carnival
Teams can be formed per carnival, and competitors may optionally support charities
Entry numbers start from 1 per event
Timing data is recorded, and team names can repeat in different carnivals

📂 Tasks Summary

🔧 Task 1: DDL
Define remaining tables (COMPETITOR, ENTRY, and TEAM) in SQL
Use appropriate types, constraints, and column-level comments
Maintain consistency with the provided schema and ERD

📥 Task 2: Insert Data
Insert a variety of sample records:
At least 15 competitors with diverse affiliations
Around 30 entries spread across multiple carnivals
Multiple teams, with re-used names in different carnivals
Ensure all inserts are valid and consistent
You may use AI-generated or real-life inspired data

🔄 Task 3: Data Manipulation
Insert new competitors and team data
Update team affiliations, manage charity support
Use transactions, sequences, and appropriate rollback handling
Reflect real-world actions like disbanding teams or editing entries

🧱 Task 4: Schema Modifications
Add new fields to existing tables
Modify schema to allow multi-charity donations
Ensure backward compatibility and preserve existing data

📊 Task 5: SQL Queries
Write advanced SQL queries involving joins, grouping, and aggregations
Examples include:
Team popularity by carnival
Carnival event participation breakdowns
Event record holders with best times
All queries should return readable and meaningful output

🌐 Task 6: MongoDB & JSON
Convert Oracle-style records into structured JSON
Insert and query documents using MongoDB-style scripts
Include filters for specific events, nested team/member structures, and updates
