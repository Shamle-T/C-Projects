Card Game Project
This project involves the development of a card game that helps demonstrate key concepts of algorithms and data structures. It is designed for learning and applying algorithmic principles while avoiding the use of built-in Python data structures and algorithms.

Key Features of the Project:

Card Game Rules: The objective of the game is to be the first player to discard all cards. Each card has a color and a label, with special black cards that have unique abilities.

No Built-in Data Structures: The project requires the implementation of custom data structures for the game. Built-in structures like lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets are not allowed.

Custom Sorting: Sorting in the game must be handled by implementing a custom sorting algorithm or using a custom data structure designed to facilitate sorting.

Restrictions on Libraries and Tools: The project restricts the use of external libraries, machine learning, generative AI, or any other advanced AI tools.

Configuration File: All constant numbers should be referenced from a provided configuration file to maintain flexibility and consistency in the code.

Testing Environment: The program will be tested using Python version 3.10.0 or later to ensure compatibility.

This project challenges the developer to build the card game while adhering to strict constraints and guidelines, providing an opportunity to deepen the understanding of core programming concepts without relying on higher-level libraries.
